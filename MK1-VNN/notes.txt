SOLVED{The values of the matrices in the weights vector of the neural network are changed as soon as initialize_parameters function ends
	OR shape not being saved correctly}

figure out deallocating shape vars in matrix class

storing weights/bias data like pickling in python

work in failsafe for batch overflow in trainandpropogate in DNN

verify input arrays to trainandpropogate should be 2 *1 matrices (vert vectors)
